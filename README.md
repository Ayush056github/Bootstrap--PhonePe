# Bootstrap--PhonePe
Created a static phone display website using Bootstrap with a fixed layout targeted for mobile screens. The site showcases phone models with structured content using Bootstrapâ€™s predefined components like cards, buttons, and navbar. Although not responsive, it demonstrates proper layout structuring using a component-based design approach.
